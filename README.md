WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application<br/>
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database<br/>
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts<br/>
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON<br/>
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia<br/>
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database<br/>
